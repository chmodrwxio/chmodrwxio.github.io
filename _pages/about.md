<p>Hello friend.</p>

<p>This blog will be in a state of evolution and I thank you in advance for your patience.</p>

<p>$()dayjob: Cyber threat intelligence analyst with a background in the healthcare sector.  This has formed my core values and ethics of who I am as a human and a professional. You will observe that undertone in my writings.</p>

<p>I am also a woman.  This is an identity that I resisted to acknowledge in my early years, as I doubted it’s contribution to my professional development.  Life experiences have opened my eyes very widely since then and I will share experiences with you as deemed appropriate because after all, it is my position that the industry at large is about the greater good and protecting the vulnerable – not about gender.</p>

<p>Onto my alphabet soup:</p>

<p>Certifications and Training: <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CEHv10-Brochure.pdf/ “Certified Ethical Hacker”">Certified Ethical Hacker</a>, <a href="https://www.dsac.gov/events/integrated-analyst-symposium/ “Integrated Analyst (DSAC)">Integrated Analyst (DSAC)</a>, <a href="https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/course/91114/cybersec-first-responder-threat-detection-and-response/ “Cybersec First Responder">Cybersec First Responder</a>, and multiple threat detection security tool training sessions.</p>

<p>Interests and Areas of Expertise: IoT Security, OSINT, threat detection, and threat intelligence.</p>
