<p>Author’s Forward:</p>

<p>After my <a href="https://chmodrwx.io/$-grep-E-'cognitive-bias'/" title="opening post">opening post, I had mapped out a plan to discuss the risks of cognitive biases during investigative analysis. While I do have those sitting in my draft folder, I felt it necessary to place that aside for now.</p>

<p>I haven’t always worked in cyber. For the first decade and a half of my professional career, I worked in what we describe as a <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28621/shadow-it" title="shadow IT">shadow IT/pseudo biomedical role directly supporting Physicians and Nurses. While I agree *today* that decentralized support teams have inherent security risks, I still advocate the _benefits_of having dedicated onsite FTEs that understand the needs/urgency/patient demographics of the specific departments they support.</p>

<p>What I need to emphasize is that you _cannot_ work in those roles with a sense of apathy. It is unfair to every patient that depends on the clinical staff to care for them and by proxy – folks like “former me” to step up and assist when the technology was overly complicated and required intervention when things were not working correctly.</p>

<p>I would interact with patients and families in a technical capacity to either “prep” them for a scan that a system required or assisted a team with a patient due to some significant complexity. Other interactions were just social happenstances in the hospital hallways, but that is life in healthcare: the only consistency was that nothing was consistent. Plan for and expect anything.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how I could’ve prepared myself for this.</p>

<p>As an analyst and investigator, I believe that self-awareness and emotional intelligence are as critical of skills as are those that give you the extended alphabet soup behind your name. Taking inventory of what values matter most, writing your <a href="https://prsay.prsa.org/2018/03/26/what-is-your-personal-code-of-conduct/" title="code of ethics">code of ethics, and other exercises to understand the core of who you is how you can understand how to use those talents to be the best professional possible.</p>

<p>For me, one of my deepest values is to protect the vulnerable within the capacity that I am able.</p>

<p>I need to be honest with you: last week was the worst 5 days of my professional life. In the field of healthcare cyber when operations are 100% focused on keeping the infrastructure intact and moving to serve the community during this historic time, to see the volume of threat campaigns exploiting our current crisis. I trust you come here because you are already aware of what is happening in the community.</p>
